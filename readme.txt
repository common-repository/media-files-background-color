Pick a custom bg color for media files in Settings > Media. Useful when working with white files on transparent background.

== Description ==

Enables replacing the default background color of WordPress media files (*#f8f8f8*) with any other color using a color picker under **[*Settings > Media*]**. Particularly useful when working with white media files on transparent background.

I decided to wrap this fix as a plugin after building a few websites where I used white shapes on transparent backgrounds, since it was nearly impossible to tell one image from another. Since I took the time to write it, I thought: why not share it?

Happy WordPress-ing!
